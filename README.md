## About

(This fork is a continuation of the abandoned [sourceforge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dunedynasty/) - see [development history](#development-history) for details.)

_Dune Dynasty_ is an enhancement of the classic real-time strategy game
_Dune II_ by Westwood Studios. It's goal is to make _Dune II_ playable on modern systems with additional features, bugfixes and QoL-improvements. It is not a remake. It builds upon the

### Development History

_Dune Dynasty_ was initially developed by __David Wang__, with the source code hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dunedynasty/). Its last official version was v1.5.7 from 2013. After that __David Wang__ added lots of new features (mainly multiplayer) up until 2015, but never released a new version. Later some github-repos emerged with additional fixes and improvements (by [1oom-fork](https://github.com/1oom-fork) and [neg3ntropy](https://github.com/neg3ntropy/dunedynasty)), but again no new release. This fork is intended to merge these improvements, fix further bugs, add minor features, and provide new releases (v1.6.0+) with binary download-packages for Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Alternatives

Here are some alternatives for enjoying _Dune II_ on modern systems:

- [___OpenDUNE___](https://github.com/OpenDUNE/OpenDUNE): Reverse-engineered source port of _Dune II_, upon which _Dune Dynasty_ is based on. It's goal is to keep it as close to the original as possible and thus has significantly less features and modernizations than _Dune Dynasty_. _OpenDUNE_ and _Dune Dynasty_ can both read original file formats (e.g. save games).
- [___Dune Legacy___](https://dunelegacy.sourceforge.net/): A _Dune II_ clone / engine recreation / remake with a similar feature-set as _Dune Dynasty_, but deviating more from the original's look and feel. Has multiplayer support and map editor.
- [___Dune II - The Maker___](https://dune2themaker.fundynamic.com/): Another _Dune II_ remake with modern features and upscaled graphics. Also deviates quite a bit from the original's look and feel.
- There is also a [___Dune II mod for OpenRA___](https://github.com/OpenRA/d2/wiki), an open source engine for the early _Command & Conquer_ games.
- A unique and amazing take on the game is [___UnDUNE II___](https://liquidream.itch.io/undune2) - a de-make re-created from scratch in PICO-8.
- _Dune II_ is also perfectly playable using [DOSBox](https://dosbox-staging.github.io/).

_Dune Dynasty_'s unique selling points are probably it's faithfulness to the look and feel of the original (due to it basing on an [engine re-creation](https://github.com/OpenDUNE/OpenDUNE) of the original) combined with many control modernizations, it's support for [fan-generated campaigns](#custom-campaigns), [various music soundtracks](#external-music-sets) and multiplayer.

## Changes

You can find the list of changes between versions in the file [CHANGES.txt](CHANGES.txt).

## Download

The most current Windows, macOS and Linux binaries and source code can be downloaded from the Github release page:

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/gameflorist/dunedynasty?display_name=tag&label=Latest%20Release&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/gameflorist/dunedynasty/releases)

## Installation

You will need the `\*.PAK` data files from the EU v1.07 release of _Dune II_. See the file [data/FILELIST.TXT](/dist/data/FILELIST.TXT) for a complete list of needed files.

Place them into one of the following places:

 1. In a directory named `data` next to the dunedynasty executable (or `Dune Dynasty.app` using the MacOS App-Bundle).
    This is the simplest option.

 2. In your personal data directory.
    The location depends on your operating system:

    - Windows 64bit:  
      `C:\users\<your user>\AppData\Roaming\Dune Dynasty\data`

    - Windows 32bit:  
      `C:\users\<your user>\Application Data\Dune Dynasty\data`

    - macOS:  
      `$HOME/Library/Application Support/dunedynasty/data`

    - Unix:  
      `~/.local/share/dunedynasty/data`

Once the data files are in place, you may start the game by running
`dunedynasty.exe` or `dunedynasty`.

### Special installation instructions for Linux

On Linux you will also have to install the libraries __Dune Dynasty__ depends on:

```shell
sudo apt install liballegro5.2 liballegro-acodec5.2 liballegro-image5.2 libenet7 libfluidsynth3 libmad0 libgl1
```

If `libfluidsynth3` is not available on your distribution, try `libfluidsynth2` instead.

## Configuration

Just as the data-files, the configuration file `dunedynasty.cfg` will be read from one of two places:

 1. In the same directory as the dunedynasty executable (or `Dune Dynasty.app` using the MacOS App-Bundle).

 2. In a personal data directory. This is the default behaviour - meaning `dunedynasty.cfg` will be created here on initial launch.
    The location depends on your operating system:

    - Windows 64bit:  
      `C:\users\<your user>\AppData\Roaming\Dune Dynasty\dunedynasty.cfg`

    - Windows 32bit:  
      `C:\users\<your user>\Application Data\Dune Dynasty\dunedynasty.cfg`

    - macOS:  
      `$HOME/Library/Application Support/dunedynasty/dunedynasty.cfg`

    - Unix:  
      `~/.config/dunedynasty/dunedynasty.cfg`

See the sample file `dunedynasty.cfg-sample` for a list of configuration
options.  You can modify the existing `dunedynasty.cfg` file or
replace it with `dunedynasty.cfg-sample`.

### Portable mode

If you place `dunedynasty.cfg` in the same directory as the dunedynasty executable (or `Dune Dynasty.app` using the MacOS App-Bundle), _Dune Dynasty_ will operate in portable mode - keeping everything (e.g. savegames) inside the install directory.

### Video Settings

Display mode and resolution can be changed in the game's "Options and Extras" menu. The game initially launches in _Fullscreen Window_ mode (using your Desktop-resolution).

You might want to increase or decrease the scaling factors of the menubar, sidebar and viewport. You can do this in-game in the __Game Control__ menu.

### Aspect ratio correction

In contrast to modern displays, old CRT-monitors had rectangular non-square pixels. All non-in-game graphics (menus, cutscenes, mentat screens, etc.) were designed with rectangular pixels in mind. The game/map/command-screen itself however seems to have been designed for square pixels (presumably due to targetting multiple platforms), meaning it always had a rather stretched look in the original DOS version - with a tile or the construction yard not being a perfect square.

Dune Dynasty allows various options to deal with aspect ratio via the "Aspect Ratio Correction" option in the Video Options (`correct_aspect_ratio` in the config-file). It's value can be:

- __None__ (`none`): No aspect ratio correction is applied, meaning all pixels will be displayed as square pixels. This means, the game will appear squashed on modern monitors. Use this setting, if you are playing on an old CRT-monitor.
- __Menu Only__ (`menu`): Non-square pixels are used for non-in-game graphics (menu, cutscenes, mentat screens, etc.) and square pixels for the game itself. This will display all graphics in the (presumably) intended aspect ratio on modern displays.
- __Full__ (`full`): This will apply the aspect ratio correction on all graphics - essentially displaying everything as in the original DOS version on a CRT-monitor. It will retain the stretched look of the in-game graphics.
- __Auto__ (`auto`): Same as option `menu`, except when the screen height is less than 800 pixels, option `none` will be used for better readability.  
This is the default setting.

The applied correction ratio is 1.2.

## Controls

The controls should be similar to most real-time strategy games.

You can finally select multiple units by dragging a rectangle, or shift clicking. You can also select all units of the same type in the current viewport via a double click or via `Ctrl + LMB`.

Right click issues commands to units, and sets the rally point on buildings. You can also change this to Left Click (which is very useful for touchscreen input).

You can pan the viewport by keeping your right mouse-button pressed, and zoom in/out via the mouse-wheel.

Keyboard shortcuts are mostly just the first letter of the action.

```txt
A           Attack or Harvest
H           Harvest
M           Move
G, S        Guard (Stop)
P           Place constructed structure

Ctrl-1      Assign control group 1
Ctrl-2      Assign control group 2, etc.
1-0         Select control group 1-0 (press 2 times to center in viewport)

Ctrl + LMB  Select all units of the same type in current viewport
Double LMB  Select all units of the same type in current viewport
Ctrl + RMB  Set rally points for all similar buildings
Space       Focus viewport on selected structure
Tab         Select next building of the same type
Esc         Pause/Cancel factory task


-, +        Zoom in or out
[, ]        Toggle size of menu and side bars
Alt-Enter   Toggle windowed mode

F1          Mentat
F2          Options
F3          Click structure icon
F4          Select construction yard (press 2 times to center in viewport)
F5          Show current song
F6          Decrease music volume
F7          Increase music volume
F11         Toggle windowed mode
F12         Save screenshot into data directory
```

There are also keyboard shortcuts for constructing buildings with the construction yard. They are displayed in the build-panel.

### Touchscreen Support

_Dune Dynasty_ works very well with touchscreens (e.g. like Microsoft Surface Pro), since most actions are performed using the left mouse button. You can perform a right button click via a long (ca. 1 sec.) press. Commands are issued via the right button by default, but you can change this by setting `Control Style` to `Left Click` in the Game Control options. Then you can quickly select and command your units via short taps with your finger. To deselect units or structures perform a long press or simply _draw_ an empty rectangle into the sand. You can even zoom the viewport with a _pinch_ finger-movement.

## Gameplay Enhancements

_Dune Dynasty_ (and it's parent project _OpenDUNE_) feature several optional as well as always active enhancements and fixes over the original _Dune II_. A detailed list of can be found in the file [enhancement.txt](enhancement.txt).

Here is an explanation of all optional enhancements, that can be enabled in-game in the main menu or game control options. They are disabled by default (except otherwise noted).

### Gameplay options (main menu)

- __Skip introduction video:__  
  Should be self explanatory.

- __Brutal AI:__  
  Various AI changes to make the game tougher. Includes double production rate, half cost, flanking attacks, etc.

- __Fog of war:__  
  Regrowing (_Warcraft_-style) shroud.

- __Insatiable sandworms:__  
  In the original game, sandworms disappear after eating a set number of units. This makes them insatiable.

- __Raise unit cap:__  
  _Dune II_ has 3 types of unit caps:
  - A unit cap defined per house by the scenario (usually 25 for the player, and 20 for the CPU)
  - A hard-coded overall cap of 102
  - And a hard-coded cap per unit/group of units:
    - Caryalls and Ornithopters: 11
    - Saboteurs: 3
    - All others (ground units): 80  

  This enhancement sets the scenario unit cap for all houses to 50, raises the overall cap to 322 and allows a total of 300 ground units (incl. saboteurs).
  This enhancement is always enabled in multiplayer/skirmish.

- __Raise structure cap:__  
  _Dune II_ limits total structures on a map to about 70. This enhancement raises that limit by 100. This enhancement is always enabled in multiplayer/skirmish.  

  __Note:__ Games saved with this option enabled will throw an error, when loaded without this option enabled!

- __Show unit control info in outpost:__  
  Shows info about active/standby/max units to outpost text. Standby units are either:

  - in production
  - ordered in factory
  - outstanding reinforcements
  - usually 1 backup-harvester
  
  This will always be enabled in multiplayer/skirmish.

- __Instant wall construction:__  
  Reduces build time of walls to 0.

- __Extend light vehicle sight range:__  
  Increases fog uncover radius of trikes and quads from 2 to 4 tiles.

- __True game speed adjustment:__  
  _Dune II_'s game speed implementation doesn't affect scripts and other things. This enhancement takes care of that. It also fixes a bug with the range of the sonic tank.  
  (Enabled by default.)

- __Consistent directional damage:__  
  In Dune II, attack damage is heavily dependent on the direction. Horizontal attacks make only half damage, while attacks from top or bottom make full damage. This enhancement makes attack damage consistent from all directions. It is always enabled in multiplayer.

### Game control options (in-game)

- __Health bars:__  
  Show health bars either for selected or all units.  
  (Enabled for selected units by default.)

- __Hi-res overlays:__  
  Displays hi-res instead of pixelated overlays (e.g. selected unit overlay).  
  (Enabled by default.)

- __Smooth unit animation:__
  Smoother unit animations by rendering units (and bullets) as if they move every frame, and rotating top-down units to arbitrary angles.  
  (Enabled by default.)

- __Infantry squad corpses:__
  Display decaying infantry corpses.  
  (Enabled by default.)

## Saved games

Saved games are located in the `save` directory next to `dunedynasty.cfg`.
If no configuration file exists in the same directory as the executable (or `Dune Dynasty.app` using the MacOS App-Bundle), they will be in placed in a personal data directory.

The location depends on your operating system:

- Windows 64bit:  
  `C:\users\<your user>\AppData\Roaming\Dune Dynasty\save`

- Windows 32bit:  
  `C:\users\<your user>\Application Data\Dune Dynasty\save`

- macOS:  
  `$HOME/Library/Application Support/dunedynasty/save`

- Unix:  
  `~/.config/dunedynasty/save`

Saved games from _Dune II_ should work if placed there.

## Music

_Dune Dynasty_ supports the following music sources:

- Midi (using your machine's default Midi device)
- AdLib (built-in emulation)
- FluidSynth (General Midi via SoundFonts)
- Various External music sets ([see below](#external-music-sets))

By default, _Dune Dynasty_ will randomly mix music from all the available sources. You can disable any sources in the game's "__Options and Extras__"-menu (changes require a restart).

There you will also find a __Jukebox__ to listen to all available songs from all available sources.

### Midi

_Dune Dynasty_ can play music via the system MIDI output on Windows, macOS (Core Audio) and Linux (ALSA).

_Dune II_ includes midi tracks for various devices (PC Speaker, Tandy 3 voices, General Midi, MT-32). By default the General Midi (SC-55) tracks are played. You can switch to a different format in the game's Music Options (e.g. if you want to play the MT-32 tracks on real hardware or via the [MUNT](https://github.com/munt/munt/tree/master/mt32emu_win32drv_setup) emulator).

#### Windows

You can specify the MIDI device ID to use via the `midi_device_id` config parameter (default is `0`). To find out the correct device ID, you can use the tool [ListMIDI32.exe](https://www.vcode.no/VCFiles.nsf/viewByKey/ListMIDI32).

#### macOS

For macOS only Core Audio is supported. Core MIDI, which is required to play midi on external MIDI devices (e.g. real MT-32 hardware) is not supported at the moment. You can use the MT-32 (or any other) recorded music pack as a workaround instead (see [External music sets](#external-music-sets) below).

#### Linux

If you use [Timidity++] as an ALSA sequencer client on Linux you should start it with smaller buffer sizes to avoid the "drunk drummer" problem:

```txt
timidity -iA -B 4,8
```

### FluidSynth

FluidSynth allows playing music via a specified SoundFont. You will need
to set the `sound_font` path in the [configuration file](#configuration) to an
appropriate sound font (.sf2) file, e.g.

```ini
[audio]
sound_font=/usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2
```

Popular SoundFonts are e.g.:

- [Timbres of Heaven](https://midkar.com/soundfonts/index.html)
- [Arachno Soundfont](https://www.arachnosoft.com/main/soundfont.php)

### External music sets

_Dune Dynasty_ can play various external music sets, e.g. recordings of the original PC or Sega Mega Drive soundtrack, music from different Dune games like _Dune 2000_ or Cryo's 1992 _Dune_, or even the motion picture soundtracks.

Each of these have their own subdirectory in the `music` directory. Instructions and download/purchase links are provided below and in the respective `FILELIST.TXT` files.

After installation of a music set, you can check it's availability in the "Music" section of the game's "Options and Extras" menu. There you can also enable/disable music sets for random play.

You can also disable individual songs from music sets. You have to do this by editing your config-file though.

Example: If you want to include Dune 2000 music, but exclude "Robotix":

```ini
[music/dune2000]
ROBOTIX=0
```

## Custom campaigns

_Dune Dynasty_ supports various fan-made campaigns:

- [Dune 2 eXtended](http://forum.dune2k.com/topic/18360-dune-2-extended-project/)
- [MrFlibble's Alternate Scenarios](https://mega.nz/file/gGUUSZbI#DwUrH3AL6sABUX2Y2wlXfblTNM_h41jq0HQnC2sLjnA)
- [Stefan Henriks' Atreides campaign](http://arrakis.dune2k.com/downloads.html)
- [Super Dune II](http://forum.dune2k.com/topic/20065-super-dune-ii-classic/)

These should be placed in the existing subdirectories inside the `campaign` directory.

Click the arrows next to the __"The Building of a Dynasty"__ subtitle in the main menu to switch between campaigns.

You can also create your own campaigns.  A campaign should consist of
a `META.INI` file, a `REGIONX.INI` file for each playable House, where X
is the first letter of the House name, and a complete set of scenarios
for each House, named `SCENX001.INI` through `SCENX022.INI`.  See Stefan
Hendriks' Atreides Campaign (subfolder `shac`) as a simple example.

Each campaign can also contain custom balance tweaks, specified in
`PROFILE.INI` and `HOUSE.INI`.  Please refer to the sample files in the
campaign directory for more information.

Finally, the scenarios can either be distributed as loose INI files or
as a single PAK file.  Data stored in PAK files must be listed in `META.INI`.
See _MrFlibble's Alternative Scenarios_ (subfolder `mfas`) as a simple example of
scenarios stored in a PAK file.

## Multiplayer

For ___hosting___ online multiplayer matches, make sure to forward the UDP port `10700` via your NAT-router to your hosting machine's local IP address. On the multiplayer menu-screen, you can leave the default `0.0.0.0` HOST IP address in most cases, as this will listen to all your network-connections. If this is not working, try setting it to the IP address of the network card connected to the internet.

For ___joining___ an online multiplayer match, use the host's public IP address.

## Development

### Compilation

#### General Info

The binary will be placed in the `dist` directory.

The steps below will build the release-version. You can change value of the `DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` parameter to build different versions, with the possible options being: `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo` and `MinSizeRel`.

#### Windows

1. Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/#installation).
2. For a 64bit executable, launch `MSYS2 UCRT64` from the startmenu. For 32bit, launch `MSYS2 MINGW32`.
3. Install dependencies:

    For 64bit:

    ```shell
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-allegro
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-enet
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-fluidsynth
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libmad
    ```

    For 32bit:

    ```shell
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-cmake
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gdb
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-allegro
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-enet
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-fluidsynth
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libmad
    ```

4. Perform build:

    For 64bit:

    ```shell
    ./scripts/build-windows-x64.sh
    ```

    For 32bit:

    ```shell
    ./scripts/build-windows-x86.sh
    ```

#### MacOs

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

2. Install dependencies:

    ```shell
    brew install cmake allegro fluid-synth mad enet
    ```

    If you are building for ARM64 on a x86-64 machine, you have to make sure, all required packages and their dependencies are the arm64 variant by reinstalling them using the `--bottle-tag=arm64_monterey`:

    ```shell
    PACKAGES=(argtable sdl2 dumb libogg flac libpng freetype libvorbis ca-certificates openssl@3 opus opusfile physfs theora giflib jpeg-turbo xz lz4 zstd libtiff webp pcre2 gettext glib lame mpg123 libsndfile portaudio readline allegro fluid-synth mad enet)
    for PACKAGE in "${PACKAGES[@]}"
    do
      brew uninstall --force --ignore-dependencies $PACKAGE
      brew fetch --force --bottle-tag=arm64_monterey $PACKAGE
      brew install $(brew --cache --bottle-tag=arm64_monterey $PACKAGE)
    done
    ```

3. Perform build:

    ```shell
    ./scripts/build-macos.sh
    ```

    If you are building for ARM64 on a x86-64 machine (or vice versa), you have to state the wanted architecture via the `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` flag in the cmake command. E.g.:

    ```shell
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 .
    ```

#### Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)

1. Install dependencies:

    ```shell
    sudo apt -y install build-essential cmake liballegro5-dev libenet-dev libmad0-dev libfluidsynth-dev fluidsynth
    ```

2. Perform build:

    ```shell
    ./scripts/build-linux.sh
    ```

### Debugging

You can display debugging info via the function `GUI_DisplayText` in the status bar, or via `GUI_DisplayModalMessage` as a modal message. E.g.:

```c
GUI_DisplayText("my debug info:%u, my other debug info:%u", 2, my_value, my_other_value);
GUI_DisplayModalMessage("my debug info:%u, my other debug info:%u", 0xFFFF, my_value, my_other_value);
```
